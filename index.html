      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>I have received several awards in my life. I graduated from a technical school with a degree in maintenance and repair of cars and a university with a degree in Economics and Enterprise Management.<br>

        For about 5 years I worked as a shop mechanic in a managerial position. There were 5 divisions with a total number of more than 100 people under my command.<br>
        
        I have organized a logistics company and have been doing business for 4 years. As a director, I built a sales department and a logistics department. I sold the company in September 2020. The company has been functioning up to the present time.<br>
        
        I started studying programming in 2020 on my own, I made a lot of mistakes. And I'm not working in this specialty yet, but I really want to finish the course at RS School and get my first job offer.</p>
