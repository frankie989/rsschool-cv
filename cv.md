### Code example:
How to calculate the maximum profit of selling a stock from a chart for a certain period of time.
We can buy and sell as many times as we want.
let prices1 = [1,7,1,5,3,6,4]; // in such a result, it should return 13
let prices2 = [7,6,4,3,1]; // in such a result, it should return 0
let maxProfit = function(prices) {
let result = 0
for( let i =0; i < prices.length; i++) {
  if (prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
    result += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
  }
 }

return result;
}
console.log(maxProfit(prices1)); //13
