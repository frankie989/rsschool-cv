### About me 


I have received several awards in my life. I graduated from a technical school with a degree in maintenance and repair of cars and a university with a degree in Economics and Enterprise Management.

For about 5 years I worked as a shop mechanic in a managerial position. There were 5 divisions with a total number of more than 100 people under my command.

I have organized a logistics company and have been doing business for 4 years. As a director, I built a sales department and a logistics department. I sold the company in September 2020.
The company has been functioning up to the present time.

I started studying programming in 2020 on my own, I made a lot of mistakes. And I'm not working in this specialty yet, but I really want to finish the course at RS School and get my first job offer.

### Code example:
How to calculate the maximum profit of selling a stock from a chart for a certain period of time.
We can buy and sell as many times as we want.
```
let pricesOne = [1,7,2,6,2,5,4]; // in such a result, it should return 13
let pricesTwo = [7,6,4,3,1]; // in such a result, it should return 0
let maxProfit = function(prices) {
let result = 0
for( let i =0; i < prices.length; i++) {
  if (prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
    result += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
  }
 }

return result;
}
console.log(maxProfit(pricesOne)); //13
console.log(maxProfit(pricesTwo)); //0
